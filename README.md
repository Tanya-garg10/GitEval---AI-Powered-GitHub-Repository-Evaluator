# GitEval 🚀

**GitEval** is an AI-powered GitHub repository evaluation platform that reviews projects the way recruiters and senior developers do. It analyzes public repositories and provides scores, insights, and a personalized improvement roadmap.

## 🔍 What is GitEval?

GitEval acts as a **virtual code reviewer and mentor**. By analyzing a GitHub repository, it evaluates code quality, structure, documentation, testing practices, and development consistency to determine how industry-ready a project is.

It is especially useful for:

* Students building portfolios
* Developers improving GitHub projects
* Recruiters doing quick project assessments
* Hackathon and academic evaluations

## ✨ Key Features

* 📊 **Repository Scoring** (out of 100 or level-based)
* 🧠 **AI-Powered Code Review**
* 📁 **Project Structure Analysis**
* 📄 **README & Documentation Evaluation**
* 🧪 **Testing & Reliability Check**
* 🧾 **Commit History & Git Practices Review**
* 🔐 **Basic Security & Error Handling Review**
* 🏷️ **Industry Readiness Tag** (Academic / Portfolio-Ready / Industry-Ready)
* 🛠️ **Personalized Improvement Roadmap**

## 🧪 Evaluation Criteria

GitEval evaluates repositories based on:

* Code quality & maintainability
* Folder structure & organization
* Documentation clarity
* Testing & reliability
* Commit frequency & consistency
* Git best practices
* Real-world relevance & usability

## 📤 Output Generated

After evaluation, GitEval generates:

1. **Score / Rating**

   * Numeric score (0–100) or
   * Level-based rating (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

2. **Repository Summary**

   * Honest overview of strengths and weaknesses

3. **Improvement Roadmap**

   * Actionable steps to enhance code, structure, testing, and documentation

4. **Red Flags (if any)**

   * Missing documentation
   * Poor commit messages
   * Unused files or bad practices

## 🧭 How It Works

1. User provides a public GitHub repository link
2. GitEval analyzes publicly available data
3. AI evaluates the repository against defined criteria
4. Structured feedback and scores are generated

## 🎯 Why GitEval?

* Simulates **real recruiter-style reviews**
* Provides **clear and actionable feedback**
* Helps improve **portfolio quality**
* Ideal for **academic submissions and exams**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

GitEval uses AI-based analysis and publicly available data. While it provides valuable insights, it should not replace professional human code reviews for critical production systems.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* CI/CD analysis
* Language-specific deep evaluation
* Visual dashboards
* GitHub OAuth integration
